<p><strong> TL; DR We need to figure out how to guarantee that software can be trusted </strong></p>
<p>In the over-simple graphic above, I've tried to map some of the key technical
roles being performed in the delivery and maintenance of complex systems and
services. I'm struggling to work out who precisely sits in the bottom right
corner, but I strongly believe we (i.e. everybody) need these people to exist,
and we need to trust their work.</p>
<p>Trust is a difficult and complex topic, and sadly it feels like there is more
evidence every day that people don't care enough about it.</p>
<p>Some politicians now seem happy to literally and blatantly disregard the facts,
as opposed to just hiding or manipulating them. And some scientists are not
much better, as the latest expose on the murky past of the sugar industry shows.</p>
<p>I can't make any strong claims about the ethics of software people in general,
but in my direct experience the folks I've worked with have tended to be
honest about their work, and I value that highly.</p>
<p>Engineers may argue and complain a lot, make mistakes, and be completely
incapable of estimating how long things will take, of course :-) But normally
technical people don't set out to deliberately do the wrong thing and lie
about it, unless they are pressured or incentivised to do so.</p>
<p>I struggle to believe that "evil software engineers" were the root cause for
the vehicle emissions cheating scandal.</p>
<p>And when software goes wrong, I would default to blaming inexperience,
confusion and incompetence, rather than conspiracy.</p>
<p>But obviously there are bad actors in software, and their influence has
become much more visible over recent years.</p>
<p>Trouble is, most people don't seem to care very much about the risks until
they are impacted directly. We're mostly happy to</p>
<ul>
<li>shovel our personal info and passwords into Google, Facebook, LinkedIn et al</li>
<li>share our most private moments and conversations via phones and websites</li>
<li>use online banks and retailers, and carry wireless electronic cards so we can be robbed-over-the-air without even the need to pick our pockets</li>
<li>travel far, at great speeds, in metal boxes that are entirely operated via
software. </li>
</ul>
<p>I think the big metal boxes will be the tipping point.</p>
<p>Now that we're connecting all the metal boxes to the network, people are
finally going to have to wake up.</p>
<p>As far as I know no-one has died as a result of hacks to cars or aeroplanes so
far, but it's bound to happen. And when it does, the media will be all over
the tech community.</p>
<p><strong>"How could you let this happen?" and "What (TF) are you going to do to fix
it?"</strong></p>
<p>I'm expecting some seismic changes as a result:</p>
<ul>
<li>A clear separation between 'developers' who just want/need to build apps and
services on top of infrastructure software which they can assume to be
trustable, and the people who commit to producing trustable infrastructure
code</li>
<li>A realisation that trustability is harder (maybe impossible) to achieve
without giving everyone access to the source code.</li>
<li>A lot of attention on how to verify, in public, that the infrastructure
software really is trustable.</li>
<li>As a result of the above, a lot more formal verifiability and verification
of open source software.</li>
</ul>
<p>And then hopefully we'll all know who we can trust to guarantee that software
is what it appears to be, and does what it claims to do.</p>
