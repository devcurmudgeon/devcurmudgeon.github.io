    <p>During a <strike>late-night drinking session</strike> technical discussion this week there was confusion about the meaning of "BSP" for Linux and Android. </p>
<p>Some folks think BSP stands for "Board Support Package". </p>
<p>But, as with <a href="http://www.devcurmudgeon.com/2010/08/28/software-chaos-ridiculously-under-managed/">SCRUM</a>, the popular view is wrong.</p>
<p>In the real world, BSP means <b>Bull Shit Project</b>.</p>
<p>BSPs are a source of extreme pain. A huge waste of time and money.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Getting permission to know the BSP even existed in the first place probably required a hard-core NDA, even though most of the important files turn out to be GPL.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then there was a struggle to find the BSP itself, because getting a login/password for the "secure" extranet took forever followed by weeks spent hunting around for the right version of the BSP amongst all the other <strike>crap</strike> premium content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It probably came as a <strike>zip file</strike> tarball containing <strike>a load of junk from the developer's source directory that day</strike> a full snapshot of the kernel<strike> hacked together two years ago during a caffeinated rush to hit some demo deadline</strike>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It was probably developed for the chipset vendor by <strike>monkeys</strike> experts who <strike>stole</strike> reused existing Windows code before getting <strike>fired</strike> rushed on to their next project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The custom stuff that the <strike>monkeys</strike> experts developed probably has their organisation's name in the source files, even though they did it in secret, as a work-for-hire, so the SoC vendor is the actual copyright owner. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Those same source files probably <b>don't state that the code is GPL</b>. Maybe the <strike>monkeys</strike> experts <strike>had no clue about licenses</strike> figured all the downstream developers could work out the license for themselves.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And now the cost of backporting patches to that two-year old kernel gets bigger every day until finally, someone will <em>have</em> to port to a newer one. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>And then the nightmare will repeat. Just with a newer BSP, that quickly becomes old and bitrotten, like the original. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>That's the real world today. We need to <b>change</b> this world.</p>
<p>So here's an idea that bubbled up during the <strike>late-night drinking session</strike> technical discussion I mentioned earlier. </p>
<p>Even though <a href="http://www.devcurmudgeon.com/2013/06/02/the-worst-metric/">LOC is a terrible metric</a>, it could help us to solve the BSP problem once and for all.</p>
<p>It's simple. <b>We need to minimize the BSP LOC</b>. </p>
<p>Repeat after me... the target is ZERO BSPLOC. I don't care if you pronounce that bee-ess-pee-ell-o-cee or bee-sploc or something else. </p>
<p>But I'm sure the target is ZERO.</p>
<p>No lines of code in the BSP. </p>
<p>This is not some devCurmudgeon pipedream. Linaro, Intel, Samsung, Calxeda and others are pushing this way already. </p>
<p>Everything in mainline. </p>
<p>That way, we know for sure that the code the <strike>monkeys</strike> experts wrote was reviewed and accepted by real Linux hackers. And that means there's a realistic chance it will continue to work as Linux moves forward.</p>
