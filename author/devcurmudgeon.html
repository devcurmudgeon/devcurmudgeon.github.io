<h6 class="subheader" title="2019-01-31T00:00:00+01:00">Thu 31 January 2019
</h6>


<p>A few years ago, while working on software build tooling, I needed to work out
what was the optimal setting for parallelising make/compile instructions.</p>
<p>Using some 64-core AWS machines I plotted what happened for building some
large projects using different settings for MAKEFLAGS -j. The results were
interesting, for example:</p>
<p><img src=/images/qtwebkit.png>
<img src=/images/gcc.png></p>
<p>For machines with up to 8 cores, I concluded that it makes sense to set</p>
<p><code>-j = number_of_cores</code></p>
<p>Once we're beyond 8-10 cores, though, the law of diminishing returns set in,
so it seemed (and still seems) to me that we'd be better off using the extra
cores for other work.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>    if &#39;max-jobs&#39; not in config:
        config[&#39;max-jobs&#39;] = cpu_count()

    if &#39;instances&#39; not in config:
        # based on some testing (mainly on AWS), maximum effective
        # max-jobs value seems to be around 8-10 if we have enough cores
        # users should set values based on workload and build infrastructure
        # FIXME: more testing :)
        if cpu_count() &gt;= 10:
            config[&#39;instances&#39;] = 1 + (cpu_count() / 10)
            config[&#39;max-jobs&#39;] = cpu_count() / config[&#39;instances&#39;]
</pre></div>


<p>For the the general case, I'm told I should have also looked at memory
bandwidth and number of independent memory channels, so ymmv.</p>

<p>No, really.</p>
<p>I mean it.</p>
<p>Refactor as much as you want, it will still smell of you.</p>

<p>Previously I asked <a href="">"Does Apple use Scrum?"...</a></p>
<p>An ex underling just slipped me the recipe for Apple's secret sauce....</p>
<p>Wanna hear? Of course you do... you too could make gazillions... but you've got to promise not to tell anybody else. </p>
<p>It goes like this...</p>
<ol>
<li>Three independent design teams produce mockups …</li></ol>

<p>So this post is just a place-holder for me to launch my new methodology - SCRUM.</p>
<p>I'd hate to have some fan copy my ideas (again) and find myself unable to prove categorically that I thought it first, so here goes...</p>
<p>Google tells me (so it must be true) that no-one …</p>

<p>I've been wading through the literature on Scrum/Agile/Lean/Kanban/Hokey-kokey for months now, and I'm still no nearer to making sense of it...</p>
<p>How on earth can folks seriously believe that the whole commercial world should turn itself upside down so programmers can have an easy life? </p>
<p>No …</p>

<p>Developing complex software well is actually very difficult to do.</p>
<p>Seems to me it requires intelligence way above average, combined with enough pig-headedness to refuse to be defeated by dumb chips and other people's code spitting random error codes at you - often for hours or days at a time.</p>
<p>It's …</p>

<p>My first brush with programming was on the <a href="http://www.rskey.org/detail.asp?manufacturer=Sinclair&amp;model=Cambridge+Programmable">Sinclair Cambridge Programmable Calculator</a>. A mathematics teacher got me hooked - if I remember well he was later knocked down and killed by a milk float.</p>
<p>Later I messed about on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX80">ZX80</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX81">ZX81</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_ZX_Spectrum">ZX Spectrum</a>, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL">Sinclair QL</a> while sailing gracelessly through …</p>

<p>After years of advising folks NOT to blog, tweet or display their <strike>backsides</strike> innermost secrets on facebook, here I am poised to break my own rules. No doubt I'll come to regret it later, but really, I need to vent.</p>
<p>Later posts will explain why...</p>
