    <p>It's a long time since I wrote the "People vs Processes and Tools" article.
Apart from being busy with other things, the main reason I don't write very
much here is that my criteria are:</p>
<ul>
<li>cover something that I really feel driven to assert in public</li>
<li>include something new/innovative/challenging, that isn't widely understood</li>
<li>stand the test of time, i.e. hopefully still be valid in a decade</li>
</ul>
<p>Suprisingly the main thing I feel compelled to write now is
another salvo at the "People, Processes, Tools" dogma, which has been  been
thrown at me a lot over the last couple of years, mostly as a magic spell to
thwart my reasoning or recommendations about a specific tool or set of tools. </p>
<p>In other words, the underlying message folks try to send me is...</p>
<p><i>"You're wrong to even be thinking about the tool(s) at this point. We
need to figure out the team and organisation first, then establish the
processes that matter... and then will be the time to choose the tools."</i></p>
<p>My internal monolog takes this further...</p>
<p><i>"...And by then, Paul, you'll no longer be one of the People involved.
And in any case we'll have established Processes that you would either refuse,
or fail, to follow. </p>
<p>And just to completely box this off, we'll be choosing a <strong>different tool</strong>,
that you don't like, to demonstrate how wrong you were.</p>
<p>And then we'll make sure you aren't one of the People that can access it."</i></p>
<p>AFAIK the <strong>People &gt; Processes &gt; Tools</strong> ordering was originally cited as part of
the Six Sigma approach. It  may be fantastic in that context - I have no
idea. But for large scale software work, particularly in established
organisations, it seems largely irrelevant to me.</p>
<p>For a start, there aren't many effective levers we can pull with <strong>People</strong>: </p>
<ul>
<li>lead, manage, incentivise</li>
<li>environment factors</li>
<li>educate/train</li>
<li>hire</li>
<li>fire</li>
</ul>
<p>Without adequate leadership, management, incentives and environment the
other factors don't actually get us very far. </p>
<p>If we have the wrong people leading, no amount of education/training will help.
Inadequate managers will struggle to even recognise, let alone hire
the right people. And firing established staff is normally surprisingly
stressful and difficult.  </p>
<p>Most of the Processes I've ever seen documented were at least in part</p>
<ul>
<li>unworkable or in practice, and/or</li>
<li>widely unused and ignored and/or</li>
<li>not relevant to the actual objectives of their organisation </li>
</ul>
<p>People who define processes without understanding both the details of the
actual work, and the stakeholder objectives and values, will typically produce
bad processes. Ironically, these documents will often be described as
"Quality Processes".</p>
<p><strong>So what's the answer?</strong></p>
<p>Based on some decades of <s>failure</s> experience, I'd like to describe an alternative:</p>
<p><strong>Philosophy =&gt; Key People =&gt; Tools and Environment =&gt; More People =&gt; Process</strong></p>
<p><strong>Philosophy:</strong> let's make sure that we're as clear as we can be about what is
the best/right work to do, before we start. This is where we need
to get our principles, intentions and objectives straight. We'll need to
adapt/improvise as we go, but doing the thinking to establish the fundamentals early can avoid a huge amount of waste and grief later.</p>
<p><strong>Key People:</strong> now onboard the (excellent, small, core) set of Key People,
selected for their knowledge and ability, to lead/drive/implement the initial
phase, which will be...</p>
<p><strong>Tools and Environment:</strong> choose the best Tools for the work, and set them up
in an Environment which</p>
<ul>
<li>is dogfooded (used and tested by the Key People)</li>
<li>is reliable, reproducible, backed up etc</li>
<li>causes minimal friction for the work</li>
<li>is locked down so normal users working in good faith can't actually break
  anything</li>
<li>has appropriate gates for review/quality/validation/signoff (but note that
  gates can cause bottlenecks and friction)</li>
<li>is simple and obvious for users who are competent and experienced in the work</li>
<li>is self-service (minimal handover/wait-steps) so users can get on with their
  jobs</li>
<li>provides enough basic documentation for new users to get going quickly</li>
<li>provides immediate and correct feedback from user actions so that
  problems and documentation can be improved quickly and effectively</li>
<li>collects and maintains evidence about the work done</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>More People:</strong> Onboard the rest of the team, preferably in phases, and:</p>
<ul>
<li>fix the problems they encounter</li>
<li>document the things they find confusing or unclear</li>
<li>measure the bottlenecks and do everything practical to reduce them and
  increase overall throughput</li>
</ul>
<p>Once this is working, the remaining step is...</p>
<p><strong>Process:</strong> Now that everything is running, we can relatively easily document
what the actual processes are.</p>
<p>However, this may not actually be worth doing:</p>
<ul>
<li>we already have appropriate tools for the job, in a low-friction environment</li>
<li>we already have with evidence of appropriate reviews/approvals and outputs</li>
<li>we are already measuring our throughput and reducing bottlenecks</li>
</ul>
<p>Apparently this reasoning makes me philosophically incompatible
with some audit-driven organisations.</p>
